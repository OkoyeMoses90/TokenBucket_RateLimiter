# TokenBucket_RateLimiter
A Python implementation of the Token Bucket algorithm for rate limiting. It dynamically refills tokens based on elapsed time and controls request rates to ensure fairness. Ideal for managing burst traffic and steady flows, this project provides a simple, effective way to integrate rate-limiting into applications.
