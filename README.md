# TokenBucket: A Python Implementation of the Token Bucket Algorithm
The TokenBucket repository provides a Python implementation of the Token Bucket algorithm, a widely-used rate-limiting mechanism. This algorithm is ideal for controlling the flow of requests or events in software systems, ensuring fair usage and protecting against overloads caused by bursty traffic.

# Features
Dynamic Token Refill: Tokens are replenished over time based on a specified refill rate.
Customizable Capacity: Set the maximum number of tokens the bucket can hold.
Rate Limiting: Efficiently handle requests by checking and deducting tokens as needed.
Bursty Traffic Support: Allows occasional bursts while maintaining overall rate limits.

# How It Works
The Token Bucket algorithm works by maintaining a "bucket" that holds a fixed number of tokens. Each incoming request requires a certain number of tokens to proceed. Tokens are refilled at a constant rate, and the bucket cannot exceed its maximum capacity. If a request arrives when there arenâ€™t enough tokens in the bucket, it is denied, enforcing rate limits.

# Key Steps:
Refilling the Bucket: Tokens are replenished based on the elapsed time since the last refill.
Checking Tokens: For each request, the algorithm checks if there are enough tokens in the bucket.
Processing Requests: If tokens are available, the request is processed, and the required tokens are deducted. Otherwise, the request is denied.
